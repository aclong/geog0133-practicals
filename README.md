# GEOG0133 Terrestrial Carbon: modelling and monitoring
### J GÃ³mez-Dans & P Lewis


## Practical 1: A simple Earth System Model

This exercise aims to show a very simple energy balance model of the Earth system.


## Practical 2: Per Capita Carbon emissions

A simple exercise to understand carbon emissions. Includes fitting some very simple models.

## Practical 3: Photosynthesis modelling

A practical where the Farquhar approach to photosynthesis in vegetation is used to explore how vegetation is modelled in typical dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). The practical allows you to understand (some of) the limits to photosynthetic activity in vegetation, as well as explore the role of plant functional types (PFTs) in controlling photosynthesis. The final aim is to think how this basic leaf-level model can form the basis of a vegetation carbon model.

## Practical 4: Phenology 

Phenology is the study of recurrent natural phenomena. In this practical, you will try to develop models for vegetation phenology based on observations of plant "greenness" derived from satellite data, as well as abiotic controls (mostly temperature!).
